# Book Store Mock-up :books:

Nextjs application built with React. It consumes this JSON API: [JSON:API playground](http://jsonapiplayground.reyesoft.com/).

It is a copy of the single page application I built using only React, but this time I wanted to build it with Nextjs, TypeScript and Storybook as well. You can find the React only version here: [Book Store](https://github.com/samueldusek/book-store).

## Main features

- Go through list of books and authors
- See details for given book
- See details for given author
- Responsive design

## To run this app

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/samueldusek/book-store-nextjs-ts-storybook.git
```

```

Install dependencies
