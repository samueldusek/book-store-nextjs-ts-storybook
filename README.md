# Book Store Mock-up :books:

Nextjs application built with React. It consumes this JSON API: [JSON:API playground](http://jsonapiplayground.reyesoft.com/).

It is a copy of the single page application I built using only React, but this time I wanted to build it with Nextjs, TypeScript and Storybook as well. You can find the React only version here: [Book Store](https://github.com/samueldusek/book-store).
